# Dark Ritual Loop

This loop is probably the first thing you should do after drawing your deck. It requires only a single black mana so is easy to start with as all of our instant speed win conditions will require at least 1 generic mana.

Once this loop is done to make black mana, you can filter it into green mana by performing a [Crop Rotation loop](./crop-rotation.md) with Twilight Mire.

## Requirements 

* A discard outlet in play
* Empty gravyard and library
* An arbitrarily large number of draw triggers on the stack

## Procedure

1. Cast Dark Ritual
1. Resolve Dark Ritual
1. Discard a titan, shuffle
1. Resolve 2 draw triggers
