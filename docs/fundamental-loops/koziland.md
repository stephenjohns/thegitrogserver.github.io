# Koziland

Koziland loops were first developed by Leptys, and are the basis of almost all the loops we currently use in the deck. The general process is to enter what is called the Koziland state; a land and a titan in your library, with nothing in your graveyard.

Entering this state is simple enough:
1. Discard a titan, shuffle
1. Discard a land, draw
1. Discard the titan again, shuffle

From here, Koziland loops are those which rely on stacking several draw triggers by discarding and dredging Dakmor. When you dredge Dakmor in this state, you'll have two triggers to put onto the stack, and can stack them so that the shuffle resolves first. This allows you to respond to the draw just created by doing it again.
